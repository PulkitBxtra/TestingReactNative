xtraBite is powered by a CMS called [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/), which enables us to bring you the most up-to-date menus and restaurant information. Our menus and restaurant data are stored securely and are easily accessible through our app. 

To manage the content on our app, we use Sanity's intuitive content studio. You can explore our content studio by clicking the button below:
